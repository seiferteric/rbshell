#RbShell
--------------

This is an expiriment to see if I can turn a ruby DSL into a fully fleged shell. THe idea is that I can replace most linux/unix commands with custom methods that will return ruby objects. This will allow you to operate on these returned objects instead of parsing strings like you normally do in bash etc.
